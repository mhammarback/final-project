# Final Project - Consent üçÉ
This i my final project during the Technigo Bootcamp 2020/2021, Consent.
A interactive learning tool that could be used for educational purposes.

# About 
I decided to try to combine as much of the knowledge I‚Äôve learned from the bootcamp and build a project with a topic that i care about. Therefore my project can be consider a "wide" project, but it's core is to help people learn about consent and then give them more tools to continue having a discussion.  


# Pages
- Home, welcome page and links to the other pages. 
- Lawbook, here you can read what the actuall lawbook says about consent.  
- Discussion Cards, here you have cards with consent topics you and your friends/classmates can use to start a conversation. 
- Forum, Share a thought about consent. 
- Sign up/Sign in, Once logged in you can take a consent quiz!

# Planning üß©
I used Figma to create a basic design and prepare for how i wanted my different pages to look like. 
I started with creating my MVP both for the backend and the frontend. Then i went back to my backend only when i could decide that i had time over to add more functionality.
