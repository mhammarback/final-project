# Authentication Project 🍃

This project's main goal was to use create a fullstack Authentication Page with Signup and Login.
Once you have logged in you can reveal a secret message as well as logout.

# Planning & What we learned 🧩

We started with the backend creating endpoints and mongoose model called User. Then we added the authentication for the secure endpoints
We used a redux store to be able to use the different states as per the requirement of the forms and to display data.
We used react router to be able to navigate between pages.
After Logging in you have two choices either to view a secret message or you have the option to logout.
